You way have issue import termcolor error, just copy the file /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages to 
the BeeF-Over-Wan folder(the folder that git cloned and just do 'ls' if issues on finding the folder)

after that always run the script as root 

Ex:(entirely)
sudo su root(enter the password)
cd BeeF-Over-Wan
python BeefOverWan.py

#I dont think there will be problem with ngrok apache.
